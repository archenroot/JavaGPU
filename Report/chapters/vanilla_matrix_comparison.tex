The following plot (figure \ref{fig plot matrix both}) is a comparison of the base values taken as a reference for the  test battery concerning the matrix multiplication on a vanilla Java code.

On the graph is plotted the base values used to compute the speedup and a measure based on the average of 5 executions. This plot demonstrates that no edge cases happened while taking the base values. The two plots show a similar behavior and even sometimes the same values.

It is worth noting that the second measure took place 2 weeks after the first one.
